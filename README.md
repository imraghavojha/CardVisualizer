# CardVisualizer üé¥

CardVisualizer is a C++ library for drawing playing cards in various designs directly in the terminal. Easily display individual or multiple cards with different design variations, including options for showing turned (hidden) cards.

## Features ‚ú®

- Draw individual cards with different variations.
- Draw multiple cards side by side.
- Display a turned card with different design variations.

## Installation üöÄ

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/imraghavojha/CardVisualizer.git
    cd CardVisualizer
    ```

2. **Compile the library:**

    ```sh
    g++ -std=c++11 -o card_visualizer main.cpp CardDrawer.cpp
    ```

3. **Run the example:**

    ```sh
    ./card_visualizer
    ```

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### Creating a Card

Create a `Card` object with the following constructor:

```cpp
Card card_name("CardName", 'Symbol', 'Design', Variation, Turned);
```

- `CardName`: The name of the card (e.g., "Ace", "King").
- `Symbol`: The symbol of the card (e.g., 'A' for Ace, 'K' for King).
- `Design`: The design character of the card (e.g., 'S' for Spades).
- `Variation`: The design variation of the card. Possible values are 1 (Minimalist), 2 (Ornate), 3 (Rounded), 4 (Dotted), 6 (Slashed).
- `Turned`: A boolean value indicating whether the card is turned (hidden) or not.

### Drawing a Single Card

Draw a single card using `draw_card`:

```cpp
#include "CardDrawer.h"

int main() {
    CardDrawer::Card ace_of_spades("Ace", 'A', 'S', 3, false);  // Rounded design
    CardDrawer::draw_card(ace_of_spades);
    return 0;
}
```

### Drawing Multiple Cards

Draw multiple cards side by side using `draw_multiple_cards`:

```cpp
#include "CardDrawer.h"
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<CardDrawer::Card> cards = {
        {"Ace", 'A', 'H', 1, false},
        {"King", 'K', 'S', 2, false},
        {"Queen", 'Q', 'D', 3, false},
        {"Jack", 'J', 'C', 4, false},
        {"Ten", 'T', 'H', 6, false}
    };

    CardDrawer::draw_multiple_cards(cards);
    return 0;
}
```

### Drawing a Turned Card

Draw a turned card with `Turned` set to `true`:

```cpp
#include "CardDrawer.h"

int main() {
    CardDrawer::Card turned_card("Turned", ' ', ' ', 1, true);  // Turned card
    CardDrawer::draw_card(turned_card);
    return 0;
}
```

## Sample Outputs üì∏

### Single Card - Rounded Design

For a card with name "Ace", symbol 'A', design 'S', and Rounded design (Variation 3):

```
.-------.
(A      )
(       )
(   S   )
(       )
(      A)
'-------'
```

### Multiple Cards

For cards with names "Ace", "King", "Queen", "Jack", and "Ten":

```
+-------+  +-------+  +-------+  +-------+  +-------+  
|A      |  |K      |  |Q      |  |J      |  |T      |  
|       |  |       |  |       |  |       |  |       |  
|   H   |  |   S   |  |   D   |  |   C   |  |   H   |  
|       |  |       |  |       |  |       |  |       |  
|      A|  |      K|  |      Q|  |      J|  |      T|  
+-------+  +-------+  +-------+  +-------+  +-------+
```

### Turned Card - Minimalist Design

For a turned card:

```
+-------+
|       |
|       |
|       |
|       |
|       |
|       |
